<p>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT [FREE LICENSE]</p>
<p>Please read this End User Licence Agreement (the “Agreement”) carefully. Taking any step to install, access or otherwise use the Software (as defined below) constitutes your consent to this Agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement is between: i) you; and ii) KAP Tanudiredja, Wibisana,  Rintis, dan rekan (“PwC” or “we” or “us”) concerning your installation of, access to or other use of the software known as “Intelligent Data Assistant” (together with any materials and services provided with or available on or through such software, successor software(s) to such software, the “Software”). This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions posted by PwC through the Software, or otherwise made available to you by PwC.</p>
<p>By installing, accessing or otherwise using the Software, you affirm that you are of legal age to enter into this Agreement or, if you are not, that you have obtained parental or guardian consent to enter into this Agreement.</p>
<p>If you are an individual installing, accessing or otherwise using the Software on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which you are associated (an “Organization”), then you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such Organization to this Agreement. References to “you” and “your” in this Agreement will refer to both the individual using the Software and to any such Organization; however, if such Organization and PwC enter into a separate written agreement relating to the Software or other subject matter of this Agreement, such separate written agreement will govern such Organization’s installation of, access to and other use of the Software and supersede this Agreement to the extent and as set forth in such separate written agreement.</p>
<p>This Agreement contains a mandatory arbitration provision that, as further set forth in Section 17 below, requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or any other court proceedings, or class actions of any kind.</p>
<p>1. Changes. We may change this Agreement from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by e-mail. Any such changes will not apply to any dispute between you and us arising prior to the date on which we posted the revised Agreement incorporating such changes, or otherwise notified you of such changes.</p>
<p>Your installation, access, or other use of the Software following any changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates when this Agreement was last changed. We may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the Software; charge, modify or waive any fees required to install, access or otherwise use the Software; or offer opportunities to some or all Software users.</p>
<p>2. Jurisdictional Issues. The Software is available for installation from Indonesia, and is not intended to subject PwC to any non-Indonesian jurisdiction or law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Software is installed by you outside of the Republic of Indonesia, the applicable governing law will apply as set forth in Section 17. The Software may not be appropriate or available for installation, access or other use in some non-Indonesian jurisdictions. Any installation, access or other use of the Software is at your own risk, and you must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in doing so. We may limit the Software’s availability at any time, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction that we choose.</p>
<p>3. Prohibited Activities. In connection with the Software, you must not (and must not permit any third party to):</p>
<p>● Except as otherwise agreed by PwC, use the Software for any commercial purpose, including using the Software for or in connection with any facility management, service bureau or time-sharing purposes, services, or arrangements, or otherwise use the Software for processing data or other information on behalf of any third party.</p>
<p>● Use the Software for any purpose that is fraudulent or otherwise tortious or unlawful.</p>
<p>● Interfere with or disrupt the operation of the Software or the servers or networks used to make the Software available, including by hacking or defacing any portion of the Software; or violate any requirement, procedure or policy of such servers or networks.</p>
<p>● Reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works of, sell, rent, lease, loan, timeshare, distribute or otherwise exploit any portion of (or any use of) the Software except as expressly authorized herein, without PwC’s express prior written consent.</p>
<p>● Reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of the Software, except where such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p>● Remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice on the Software.</p>
<p>● Incorporate any portion of the Software into any product or service or other software, without PwC’s express prior written consent.</p>
<p>● Systematically download and store content made available through the Software.</p>
<p>● Use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application or other manual or automatic device to retrieve, index, “scrape,” “data mine” or otherwise gather content made available through the Software, or reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Software, without PwC’s express prior written consent.</p>
<p>● Use the Software on multiple processors, without PwC’s express prior written consent.</p>
<p>4. Registration; No Sharing of User Name and Password. You may need to register or otherwise establish an account to install, access or otherwise use all or part of the Software. We may reject, or require that you change, any user name, password or other information that you provide to us in registering or otherwise establishing an account. Your user name and password are for your personal use only and should be kept confidential. You must not provide your user name and password to any other person or entity for purposes of installing, accessing or otherwise using the Software. You, and not PwC, are responsible for any use or misuse of your user name or password, and you must promptly notify us of any confidentiality breach or unauthorized use of your user name or password, or your account.</p>
<p>You must not, directly or indirectly, allow any other person or entity to use your account to install, access or otherwise use the Software.</p>
<p>5. Submissions. Software users may make available certain materials (each, a “Submission”) through or in connection with the Software (for example, reports generated by using the Software), including through the Software’s interactive services or sharing functionality. PwC has no control over and is not responsible for any use or misuse (including any distribution) by any third party of Submissions. If you choose to make any of your personally identifiable or other information publicly available through the Software, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>6. Licence. For purposes of clarity, you retain ownership of your Submissions. For each Submission, you hereby grant to us a worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and fully sublicensable (through multiple tiers) licence, without additional consideration to you or any third party, to reproduce, distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), create derivative works of, adapt, modify and otherwise use, analyse, exploit and practice such Submission, in any format or media now known or hereafter developed, and for any purpose (including promotional purposes, such as testimonials).</p>
<p>In addition, if you provide to us any ideas, proposals, suggestions or other information or materials (“Feedback”), whether related to the Software or otherwise, such Feedback will be deemed a Submission, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that such Feedback is not confidential, and that your provision of such Feedback is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction, and does not place PwC under any fiduciary or other obligation.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant the licences granted in this Section, and that your Submissions, and your provision thereof through and in connection with the Software, are complete and accurate, and are not fraudulent, tortious or otherwise in violation of any applicable law or any right of any third party. You further irrevocably waive any “moral rights” or other rights with respect to attribution of authorship or integrity of materials regarding each Submission that you may have under any applicable law under any legal theory.</p>
<p>7. Monitoring. We may (but have no obligation to) monitor, evaluate, alter or remove Submissions before or after they appear in connection with the Software, or analyse your installation, access or other use of the Software. We may disclose information regarding your installation, access and other use of the Software, and the circumstances surrounding such installation, access and other use, to anyone in connection with performing services for you, in connection with operating the Software, or for analytic, statistical, security, quality control, and similar purposes (including in aggregate form, e.g., to analyse systems performance).</p>
<p>8. Your Limited Rights. The Software is licensed (not sold) to end users. Except as otherwise agreed by PwC, we hereby grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable licence to install, access and otherwise use a single copy of the Software on a single device solely for your personal, non-commercial use in the Territory, subject to your compliance with this Agreement and solely for so long as you are permitted by PwC (and, if applicable, your Organization) to install, access and otherwise use the Software on a single device solely for your personal, non-commercial use in the Territory. If you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, you must immediately cease using the Software and remove (that is, uninstall and delete) the Software from the equipment on which it is installed. “Territory” means the Republic of Indonesia.</p>
<p>9. PwC’s Proprietary Rights. We and our suppliers own the Software, which is protected by proprietary rights and laws. As between you and us, the Software and all non-public information and materials (technical, business and otherwise) related to the Software (and the use of it), including Submissions of other Software users and any reports generated by using the Software, are our intellectual property and/or “Confidential Information”, as applicable, and you will not use or disclose to third parties Confidential Information except to the extent necessary to exercise your rights and fulfil your obligations under this Agreement or as required by applicable law. Our trade names, trademarks and service marks include the name “PricewaterhouseCoopers” and “PwC” and any associated logos, marks and designs. All trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos and designs on the Software not owned by us are the property of their respective owners. You may not use our trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or designs in connection with any product or service that is not ours, or in any manner that is likely to cause confusion. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Software should be construed as granting any right to use any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos or designs without the express prior written consent of the owner. For clarity and not as a limitation to the foregoing, as between you and PwC, we retain all right, title and interest in and to the patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in the Software and any derivative works thereof, subject only to the limited licences set forth in this Agreement, and you do not acquire any rights, express or implied, in the Software other than those rights expressly granted under this Agreement.</p>
<p>10. CPA Notice; PwC Related Parties. PwC may be owned by professionals who hold CPA licences as well as by professionals who are not licensed CPAs. Depending on the nature of the products and services provided to you under this Agreement (including the Software or through the Software), non-CPA owners may be involved in providing such products and services. PwC is a firm in the global network of separate and independent PricewaterhouseCoopers firms (exclusive of PwC, the “Other PwC Firms”). PwC may draw on the resources of (and subcontract to) its affiliates, the Other PwC Firms and third party contractors and subcontractors, within or outside of the Republic of Indonesia (each, a “PwC Service Provider”) for internal, administrative and regulatory compliance purposes or in connection with providing the Software. The PwC Service Providers and their and PwC’s respective partners, principals, employees and agents (collectively, the “PwC Beneficiaries”) will have no liability or obligations arising out of this Agreement, and you agree to bring any claim or other legal proceeding of any nature arising from or related to this Agreement or its subject matter against PwC and not against the PwC Beneficiaries. While PwC is entering into this Agreement on its own behalf, this Section 11 also is intended for the benefit of the PwC Beneficiaries.</p>
<p>11. Third Party Materials; Links. Certain Software functionality may make available access to information, products, technology, services and other materials made available by third parties, including Submissions (“Third Party Materials”), or allow for the routing or transmission of such Third Party Materials, including via links. By using such functionality, you are directing us to access, route and transmit to you the applicable Third Party Materials. In addition to any other terms that may apply, your use of the Software is also governed by the terms and conditions set forth on Appendix A with respect to particular Third Party Materials incorporated into or otherwise made available as a part of your access or use of the Software.</p>
<p>We neither control nor endorse, nor are we responsible for, any Third Party Materials, including the accuracy, validity, timeliness, completeness, reliability, integrity, quality, legality, usefulness or safety of Third Party Materials, or any intellectual property rights therein. Certain Third Party Materials may, among other things, be inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to be a representation or warranty by PwC with respect to any Third Party Materials. We have no obligation to monitor Third Party Materials, and we may block or disable access to any Third Party Materials (in whole or part) through the Software at any time. In addition, the availability of any Third Party Materials through the Software does not imply our endorsement of, or our affiliation with, any provider of such Third Party Materials, nor does such availability create any legal relationship between you and any such provider.</p>
<p>Your use of Third Party Materials is at your own risk and is subject to any additional terms, conditions and policies applicable to such Third Party Materials (such as terms of service or privacy policies of the providers of such Third Party Materials).</p>
<p>12. Open Source. The Software may include open source components, which are licensed for use and distribution by us under applicable open source licences. Use of these open source components is governed by and subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable open source licence.</p>
<p>13. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Software (including any information and materials made available to you in connection with using the Software) is not for any third party’s use or benefit and is not intended to be relied upon by you or any third party, including to operate or promote your business, secure financing or capital in any form, sell or underwrite securities, obtain any regulatory or governmental approvals, or otherwise be used in connection with procuring services or other benefits from any entity. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law: (a) the Software and any products, services and Third Party Materials are made available to you on an “As Is,” “Where Is” and “Where Available” basis, without any warranties of any kind, whether express, implied or statutory; and (b) PwC disclaims all warranties with respect to the Software and any products, services and Third Party Materials, including the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement and title. All disclaimers of any kind (including in this section and elsewhere in this Agreement) are made for the benefit of both PwC and the PwC Beneficiaries and their respective partners, principals, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors, suppliers and service providers (collectively, the “Affiliated Entities”), and their respective successors and assigns.</p>
<p>While we try to maintain the timeliness, integrity and security of the Software, we do not guarantee that the Software is or will remain updated, complete, accurate, correct or secure, or that installation, access to or other use of the Software will be uninterrupted. The Software may include inaccuracies, errors and materials that violate or conflict with this Agreement. Additionally, third parties may make unauthorized alterations to the Software.</p>
<p>14. Limitation of Liability. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law: (a) PwC will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages of any kind, under any contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or other theory, including damages for loss of profits, use or data, loss of other intangibles, loss of security of Submissions (including unauthorized interception by third parties of any Submissions), even if advised in advance of the possibility of such damages or losses; (b) without limiting the foregoing, PwC will not be liable for damages of any kind resulting from your installation, access or other use of or inability to install, access or otherwise use the Software or from any products, services or Third Party Materials, including from any Virus that may be transmitted in connection therewith; and (c) your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the Software or any products, services or Third Party Materials is to stop using the Software. All limitations of liability of any kind (including in this section and elsewhere in this Agreement) are made for the benefit of both PwC and the Affiliated Entities, and their respective successors and assigns.</p>
<p>15. Indemnity. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless PwC and the Affiliated Entities, and their respective successors and assigns, from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses and fees (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to (a) your use of (including installation of and otherwise accessing), or other activities in connection with, the Software (including all Submissions); and (b) any violation or alleged violation of this Agreement by you.</p>
<p>16. Termination. Either you or PwC may terminate this Agreement, with or without cause. PwC may immediately terminate this Agreement without penalty or liability: (a) if continuing to perform under this Agreement could, in PwC’s sole and absolute judgment, result in PwC’s noncompliance with any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any regulatory guidance, professional standard, or self-regulatory rule or policy, in each case as in effect from time to time; or (b) upon the occurrence of an event that, in PwC’s sole and absolute judgment, causes or would be likely to cause PwC or any Other PwC Firm not to be “independent” as required by any law, rule, regulation or professional standard relating to independence. PwC may terminate this Agreement at any time and without prior notice, for any reason, including if PwC believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement. Upon any such termination, your right to use the Software will immediately cease, and you will cease all use of the Software, return to us or destroy the Software and all related materials in your possession, and so certify to us. In addition, PwC may, without liability to you or any third party, immediately deactivate or delete your user name, password and account, and all associated materials, without any obligation to provide any further access to such materials. Sections 2 through 8 and 10 through 24 will survive any termination of this Agreement. To give full effect to the right of either party to terminate this Agreement as provided in this Section 16, both parties hereby waive the provision of the Article 1266 of the Indonesian Civil Code requiring the pronouncement of the court for the termination of contracts.</p>
<p>17. Governing Law; Arbitration. This Agreement, and any dispute relating to this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement, will be governed by and construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the domestic laws of the Republic of Indonesia. Each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdictions and venue of Indonesian National Board of Arbitration (“BANI”) in connection with any dispute or claim arising under this Agreement. The site of the arbitration shall be Indonesia. The language of arbitration shall be Indonesian. The award rendered in any arbitration commenced hereunder shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto and judgment thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction for its enforcement</p>
<p>18. Conflict; Severability. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any procedures or requirements set out in the App, the provisions of this Agreement will prevail. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, void, or illegal, it will be severed from this Agreement and will not affect, impair, or invalidate any other provision, and it will be replaced by a provision which comes closest to such severed provision in language and intent without being invalid, void, or illegal.</p>
<p>19. Compliance with Laws. You will comply with all applicable Indonesian laws, rules, and regulations in connection with your use of the Software.</p>
<p>20. Language. In the event of different interpretations between English and Indonesian language in this Agreement, the Indonesian language will prevail.</p>
<p>21. Miscellaneous. This Agreement does not, and will not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and PwC. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, that provision will be deemed severable from this Agreement and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provision. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of your rights or obligations under this Agreement without our express prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or sublicense any or all of our rights or obligations under this Agreement without restriction. No waiver by either party of any breach or default under this Agreement will be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. Any heading, caption or section title contained herein is for convenience only, and in no way defines or explains any section or provision. All terms defined in the singular will have the same meanings when used in the plural, where appropriate and unless otherwise specified. Any use of the term “including” or variations thereof in this Agreement will be construed as if followed by the phrase “without limitation.” This Agreement, including any terms and conditions incorporated herein, is the entire agreement between you and PwC relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings between you and PwC relating to such subject matter. Notices to you (including notices of changes to this Agreement) may be made by posting or linking to a revised Agreement through the Software or any updated version of the Software, by e-mail (including via links), or by regular mail. Without limitation, a printed version of this Agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.
